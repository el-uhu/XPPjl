# XPPjl
Julia interface for XPPAut

###Functionality
* Represent models as flexible custom data types in julia
* Simulate models using XPPAuto
* Store simulation data in easily accessible and well-defined way
* Save models along with simulations (data + parameters) as json files
* Import saved models

###Planned features
* AUTO integration


###Structure of the module

* `XPP.jl` - main module file for module `XPP` , wraps around the following components
* `typedefs.jl` - type specification for two custom types: 
  * `Model` - a structured representation of an XPP-model, including, ODEs, Initials, Parameters, Settings, Auxilliaries and Data
  * `SimulationData` - A datastructure that stores data from simulations generated by XPP with the corresponding variable names, initial conditions and parameters.
* `parse.jl` - functions used for importing a Model-instance from an ode-file, generating an ode-file from a model instance and parsing the output of XPP-simualtions into a SimulationData-structure.
* `run.jl` - routine for running a simulation of a model in XPPAut, and processing the output
* `io.jl` - functions for storing a model instance (including simulations) as a json file, as well as loading a model instance from such a json file
